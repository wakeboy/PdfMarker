- a breach of clause 13.7.1; or
- something else known to the purchaser but not the vendor.

13.8 If this contract says this sale is a taxable supply in full and does not say the margin scheme applies to the property, the vendor must pay the purchaser on completion an amount of one-eleventh of the price if –

13.13 If the vendor *serves* details of a *GSTRW payment* which the purchaser must make, the purchaser does not have to complete earlier than 5 *business days* after that *service* and clause 21.3 does not apply to this provision.
